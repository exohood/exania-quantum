1. **Enhanced Speed and Processing Efficiency**

**Quantum Speed up**

* Formula: Let Tqc be the time taken by quantum computing algorithms and Tcc be the time taken by classical computing algorithms for the same task. The speed up 
S is given by:
```math
  S = \frac{T_{cc}}{T_{qc}}
```
This formula demonstrates the significant reduction in processing time achieved through quantum computing.
